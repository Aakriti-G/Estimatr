# Overview
The `estimatr` package is a specialized tool in R that is optimized for design-based inference resulting in accurate and reliable estimates as it accounts for potential sources of bias and violations of statistical assumptions.
 
In this building block we will walk you through the process of estimating regression coefficients using the most commonly used functions in `estimatr`: `lm_robust()` and `iv_robust()`. We analyse data from the`wage2`[data set] (https://rdrr.io/cran/wooldridge/man/wage2.html) which is an in-built data set in R, provided by the `wooldridge` package. We are interested in examining how the education level of employees relates to their wages and to do so we use the following regression model:

{{<katex>}}
Wage_{i}  =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} Educ_{i} + \mu
{{</katex>}}

where, 
| **Variable** | **Description**            |
| :------  | :---------             |
| `wage`     | monthly earnings       |
| `educ`     | years of education     |


## Load packages


{{% codeblock %}}
```R
install.packages("estimatr")
install.packages("wooldridge")

library(estimatr)
library(wooldridge)

data(wage2)
```
{{% /codeblock %}}  


## Estimating regression models without using `estimatr`

Before diving into the `estimatr` package, let's first use the built-in `lm()` function to estimate our linear model,

{{<katex>}}
Wage_{i}  =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} Educ_{i} + \mu
{{</katex>}}


{{% codeblock %}}
```R
reg <- lm(data=wage2, wage~educ)
summary(reg)
```
{{% /codeblock %}}  

The resulting regression estimates are prone to error and inefficiency because `lm()` function is specifically designed to fit linear models that assumes homoscedasticity, which may not always hold true. 
Therefore, using the `estimatr` package is a better option, because in the case of the homoscedasticity assumption being violated, this package offers quick and easy ways to adjust standard errors, allowing for robust and clustered standard errors.

## Estimate Linear Models Using lm_robust

The `lm_robust()` function is used to get the robust standard errors from a linear regression model.

Let's re-estimate the model using robust standard errors.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
lm_robust(data=wage2, wage~educ, se_type = "HC2")
```
{{% /codeblock %}}  

It is interesting to observe that the standard errors are different from those obtained before, which shows that `estimatr` adjusted for heteroscedasticity in the regression model giving us efficient robust standard errors.


Notice the argument, `se_type`. It refers to the sort of standard error that one seeks for in the model. If nothing is specified, `estimatr` takes `HC2` as a default option which uses the HC2 (heteroscedasticity-consistent 2) estimator and includes a small sample correction to improve the accuracy of the standard errors.

However, there are different `se_types` that are appropriate for different assumptions about the error terms and sample size, and one can accordingly choose from them:

- `classical`: This option uses the classical or ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to calculate standard errors. It assumes that the error terms are homoscedastic and uncorrelated with the independent variables.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
lm_robust(data=wage2, wage~educ, se_type = "classical")
```
{{% /codeblock %}} 

We can observe that this option gives us exactly the same result as we obtained with the `lm()` function.


- `HC0`: This option uses the heteroscedasticity-consistent estimator to calculate standard errors. It allows for heteroscedasticity in the error terms, but does not correct for small sample bias.

- `HC1`: This option uses the HC1 estimator to calculate standard errors. It is similar to the HC0 estimator, but includes a different sample correction than the HC2 estimator.

- `HC3`: This option uses the HC3 estimator to calculate standard errors. It is similar to the HC2 estimator, but includes a more robust small sample correction that is less sensitive to outliers.



## Cluster-Robust Standard Errors
 
Cluster-robust standard errors are designed to allow for correlation between observations within a cluster. 
For cluster-robust inference, this package provides several estimators that are essentially analogs of the heteroskedastic-consistent variance estimators for the clustered case: `CR0` and `CR2`(default).

## Estimate Instrumental Variable (IV) Regressions Using iv_robust
The `iv_robust` function is used to estimate Instrumental Variable (IV) regressions.

Suppose IQ is a potential instrument (i.e it correlated with education but not with the error term) we can obtain the standard errors in the following way: 

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
iv_robust(data=wage2, wage~educ|IQ, se_type = "HC2")
```
{{% /codeblock %}}  



{{% summary %}}

- `estimatr` is an R package for linear estimators designed for speed and ease-of-use.

- Users can easily recover robust, cluster-robust, and other design-appropriate estimates, and options are provided to obtain standard errors that reflect heteroscedasticity.

- The package includes among others, linear regression estimators like `lm_robust()` and `iv_robust()`.

- The standard errors can be adjusted using the `se_type` argument.
